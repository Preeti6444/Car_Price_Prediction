# Car_Price_Prediction
This project implements a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on various features such as year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, engine size, and more. A user-friendly web interface is built using Flask, allowing users to input car details and get an estimated price prediction.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for estimating the market value of used cars. By leveraging historical car sales data, a machine learning model learns the relationships between car specifications and their prices. The Flask web application serves as an interactive front-end, making the prediction model accessible to anyone interested in buying or selling a used car.

## Features

* *Price Prediction:* Predicts the selling price of a car based on user-provided features.
* *User-Friendly Interface:* Simple web form for inputting car details.
* *Data Validation:* Basic validation for input fields.
* *Responsive Design:* (If implemented, mention this) The web interface is designed to be accessible on various devices.

## Technologies Used

### Backend (Flask Application)

* *Python 3.x:* Core programming language.
* *Flask:* Web framework for building the API and serving the web pages.
* *Scikit-learn:* For machine learning model development (e.g., RandomForestRegressor).
* *Pandas:* For data manipulation and preparation.
* *NumPy:* For numerical operations.
* *Joblib / Pickle:* For saving and loading the trained machine learning model and any necessary preprocessors (e.g., OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler).

### Frontend

* *HTML5:* Structure of the web pages.
* *CSS3:* Styling of the web pages (static/style.css).
* *Jinja2:* Templating engine used by Flask.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  *Clone the repository:*
    bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your_GitHub_Username]/Car_Price_Prediction.git
    cd Car_Price_Prediction
    

2.  *Create a virtual environment (recommended):*
    bash
    python -m venv venv
    

3.  *Activate the virtual environment:*
    * *On Windows:*
        bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        
    * *On macOS/Linux:*
        bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        

4.  *Install the required Python packages:*
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    (If you don't have a requirements.txt yet, create one by running pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing all dependencies.)

## Usage

1.  *Run the Flask application:*
    Ensure your virtual environment is active.
    bash
    python app.py
    

2.  *Access the application:*
    Open your web browser and navigate to the address shown in your terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

3.  *Make a prediction:*
    Fill in the car details in the form and click the "Predict Price" button to get an estimated price.
